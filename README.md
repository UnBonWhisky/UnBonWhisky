# Hello, I'm Flavien ! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ“š About Me
I'm a 23 years old student deeply passionate about cybersecurity, currently advancing my expertise at ESGI, Paris, where I'm working towards my master's degree.  
My academic journey is not just about earning a degree, it's about immersing myself in the world of cybersecurity and emerging with skills that can make a difference.

## ðŸ’» What I Do
- **Cybersecurity Enthusiast:** I spend my days (and many nights) exploring the vast, challenging, and ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. Whether it's staying ahead of the latest threats or understanding complex security systems, I'm all in.
- **Coding Hobbyist:** When I'm not delving into cybersecurity, I like to get my hands dirty with coding and scripting. Random projects are my playground â€“ they keep my skills sharp and my creativity flowing.
- **Lifelong Learner:** The quest for knowledge never ends. I'm constantly on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn, whether it's through formal education, self-study, or hands-on experience.
